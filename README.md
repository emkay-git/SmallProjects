# Replay
Replays each song from a list of mp3s for an hour. Uses [vlc.py](http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc/bindings/python.git;a=tree;f=generated;b=HEAD) which helps in using vlc in pythonic way. 
#### Setup
1. Clone the repository SmallProjects/Replay. 
2. Put the files in the folder having songs.
3. In terminal start the script as `python replay.py`

# voiceTube
Plays the song quried through voice on youtube in chrome browser. So run the program and say out the song name, it will play the first link of the youtube search automatically.</br>
