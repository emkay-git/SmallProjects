# Replay
Replays each song from a list of mp3s for an hour. Uses [vlc.py](http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc/bindings/python.git;a=tree;f=generated;b=HEAD) which helps in using vlc in pythonic way. 
### Setup
1. Clone the repo. 
2. Put the files in the folder having songs.
3. In terminal start the script as `python replay.py`
